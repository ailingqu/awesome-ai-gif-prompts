## How these GIFs are made

GPT Image 2.6 can return an animated GIF instead of a still image when you request `output_format: "gif"`. The model decides the frame count, timing and pixel size on its own.

Each prompt in this repo is sent with one extra sentence appended, which asks for a clean loop:

```text
Animate it as a short, smooth, seamlessly looping GIF with clear motion between frames.
```

### Prompt formula

**Subject** (one clear character or object) + **Motion** (1–2 verbs: waving, bouncing, drifting, flickering) + **Style** (flat illustration, chibi sticker, pixel art, photo) + **Background** (plain, high-contrast color for stickers)

### Tips

- One subject and one or two movements. Busy scenes leave less room for clear motion.
- Describe motion with verbs — *wobbling, nodding off, flickering, sliding down* — not adjectives.
- Flat illustration, chibi and pixel art styles survive small GIF sizes far better than photorealism.
- For a sticker set, repeat the exact same character description in every prompt so the pack stays consistent.
- For stickers you plan to cut out, use one flat background color far away from the character's colors.
- For flash cuts, describe each frame as a different shot; for brand reels, lock the logo position and change only the surroundings.
- Long text and complex day-to-night loops are still unreliable — keep text short and let light carry big changes.

## Stickers & Reactions

### 1. Jelly bear wobble

<img src="gifs/jelly-bear-wobble.gif" alt="Jelly bear wobble" width="360">

<sub>9 frames · 438×388 · 1.3s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A chubby round cartoon bear with a soft jelly-like body and stubby arms, squishing down and springing back up while wobbling side to side, cheeks jiggling on every bounce. Thick clean outlines, flat pastel colors, centered on a plain solid mint-green background that contrasts strongly with the bear.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep the background one flat color far from the character's colors so it can be keyed out as a transparent sticker later.

`sticker` `bouncy` `cute`

### 2. Bunny thumbs-up

<img src="gifs/bunny-thumbs-up.gif" alt="Bunny thumbs-up" width="360">

**Prompt**

```text
A small white cartoon bunny with long floppy ears and a pink nose, giving an enthusiastic thumbs-up with one paw, the paw pumping forward twice while the ears bounce. Chibi sticker style, bold outline, plain warm yellow background.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Reuse the same character description across a set (see the next two prompts) so the whole sticker pack stays consistent.

`sticker` `reaction` `sticker-pack`

### 3. Bunny laughing to tears

**Prompt**

```text
A small white cartoon bunny with long floppy ears and a pink nose, laughing so hard it rocks back and forth, eyes squeezed shut and two little tears flying out. Chibi sticker style, bold outline, plain warm yellow background.
```

`sticker` `reaction` `sticker-pack`

### 4. Sleepy bunny

<img src="gifs/bunny-sleepy.gif" alt="Sleepy bunny" width="360">

<sub>9 frames · 439×387 · 1.6s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A small white cartoon bunny with long floppy ears and a pink nose, sitting and nodding off, head slowly drooping then jerking back up, a small bubble swelling and shrinking from its nose. Chibi sticker style, bold outline, plain warm yellow background.
```

`sticker` `reaction` `sticker-pack`

### 5. Cartoon cat waving hello

<img src="gifs/cat-waving-hello.gif" alt="Cartoon cat waving hello" width="360">

<sub>9 frames · 438×390 · 1.3s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-05</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A cheerful cartoon cat waving hello.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Even a one-line prompt works for simple greetings — the model fills in style and timing.

`sticker` `greeting` `minimal-prompt`

### 6. Confused shiba head tilt

<img src="gifs/shiba-head-tilt.gif" alt="Confused shiba head tilt" width="360">

### 7. Cat typing furiously

<img src="gifs/cat-typing-laptop.gif" alt="Cat typing furiously" width="360">

<sub>16 frames · 380×242 · 1.9s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A grey tabby cat sitting at a tiny laptop and typing furiously with both front paws, paws blurring, little speed lines and sweat drops flying off. Flat cartoon sticker style, bold outline, plain pale pink background.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Speed lines and sweat drops make fast motion readable even with only a few frames.

`sticker` `work` `cat`

### 8. Frog blowing a heart

<img src="gifs/frog-heart-bubble.gif" alt="Frog blowing a heart" width="360">

<sub>16 frames · 380×252 · 2.2s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text

## Flash Cuts & Brand Reels

### 10. Flower macro flash cut

<img src="gifs/flower-macro-flash.gif" alt="Flower macro flash cut" width="360">

<sub>8 frames · 380×508 · 3.6s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A fast flash-cut sequence of eight different flower photographs, one per frame, each filling the whole frame: a red poppy shot from above with light glowing through its petals, a creamy gardenia in soft side light, blue delphinium against a deep blue background, a golden marigold macro, a pink peony from a high angle, a dark purple iris close-up, an orange lily with curled petals, and pale green hydrangea with dew drops. Realistic botanical fashion photography, each frame with a different color, distance and composition.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Describe every frame as a distinct shot. Changing color, angle and framing between frames is what makes a flash cut feel energetic.

`flash-cut` `photography` `editorial`

### 11. Cat-head logo brand reel

<img src="gifs/cat-brand-reel.gif" alt="Cat-head logo brand reel" width="360">

<sub>8 frames · 380×507 · 2.8s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A quick-cut brand reel for a fictional cat food brand called "MEOWBITE". The same flat dark-brown cat-head logo — round face, two short pointed ears, cream almond eyes, short whiskers — stays fixed at the center of every frame while everything around it changes: an orange full-bleed poster, a pink pouch of cat food, a blue ceramic cat bowl seen from above, a kraft shipping box, a round sticker, and a final dark frame with the word MEOWBITE in big cream letters. Bold graphic design, flat colors, citrus orange, cream and dark brown palette.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Lock the logo's position and size in every frame and only change the surroundings — that is what makes a brand flash read as one identity.

`flash-cut` `branding` `logo`

### 12. Sneaker colorway flash

<img src="gifs/sneaker-colorway-flash.gif" alt="Sneaker colorway flash" width="360">

<sub>5 frames · 349×883 · 1.8s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A fast flash-cut in a square frame: the same chunky sneaker seen from the side, centered and the same size in every frame, while its colorway and the full-bleed solid background change each frame: white and red on blue, black and lime on pink, cream and brown on orange, purple and silver on yellow, all-white on black. Clean studio product photography, the background fills the whole frame edge to edge.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Fix the product's angle and position, change only colors — the classic product colorway reel.

`flash-cut` `product` `fashion`

### 13. One tree, four seasons

<img src="gifs/four-seasons-tree.gif" alt="One tree, four seasons" width="360">

<sub>4 frames · 764×508 · 2.6s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
The same lone round tree on a small hill, framed identically in every frame, cycling through the four seasons: pink spring blossoms, lush green summer, orange autumn leaves falling, bare branches in winter snow. Soft flat illustration with a matching sky color for each season.
```

`flash-cut` `nature` `seasons`

## Ambient Loops

### 14. Reading by the window, day to night

<img src="gifs/window-day-to-night.gif" alt="Reading by the window, day to night" width="360">

<sub>9 frames · 413×412 · 3.1s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A girl with a short bob reading a book on a cushion by a big window, seen from the side. Outside the window the sky cycles from bright morning blue to orange sunset to a starry night and back to morning, while the room light warms up and a desk lamp switches on at night. Soft flat illustration, calm and cozy.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Day-to-night loops are harder than simple motions. Keep the character mostly still and let the light and sky carry the change.

`loop` `character` `time-lapse`

### 15. Steaming coffee loop

<img src="gifs/steaming-coffee.gif" alt="Steaming coffee loop" width="360">

**Prompt**

```text
A ginger cat curled up asleep on a rug in front of a crackling fireplace, its body gently rising and falling with each breath, flames flickering and casting warm light. Cozy flat illustration, warm orange and brown tones.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Breathing is a great tiny motion for calm loops — it reads clearly and loops naturally.

`loop` `cozy` `cat`

### 20. Lantern monkey in the snow

<img src="gifs/lantern-monkey-snow.gif" alt="Lantern monkey in the snow" width="360">

<sub>16 frames · 380×241 · 2.9s · gpt-image-2.6 · generated 2026-11-06</sub>

**Prompt**

```text
A small monkey in an olive-green hooded coat standing in a snowy pine forest at dusk, lifting a glowing amber paper lantern, looking up and blinking, then lowering the lantern back to where it started. Snow falls gently and a tiny cabin glows in the background. Soft storybook illustration, locked camera.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Give the subject a pose to return to and lock the camera — the easiest way to get a clean loop.

`loop` `character` `winter`

### 21. Sleepy fox on a mossy rock

<img src="gifs/sleepy-fox-rock.gif" alt="Sleepy fox on a mossy rock" width="360">

**Prompt**

```text
A minimal loading animation: three rounded dots in coral, violet and teal bouncing up and down one after another in a wave, with soft squash on landing. Flat vector style on a plain off-white background.
```

> 💡 **Tip:** UI loaders work best with very few elements and a plain background.
